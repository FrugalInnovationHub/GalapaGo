              The history of the colonization of the Galapagos goes back to the
              middle of the 17th century, with the arrival of the first pirates
              who used the islands as a refuge; subsequently the Norwegians
              settled on the islands promoting human settlements. {"\n\n"}
              Tourism, artisanal fishing, agriculture and handicrafts are today
              the main sources of life for the Galapagos populations. Around
              30,000 people inhabit the set of the five populated islands: San
              Crist√≥bal, Santa Cruz, Isabela, Floreana and Baltra.{"\n\n"}
              Tourism is the basis of the local economy and its main source of
              income. The archipelago currently receives 175,000 visitors a
              year. The second economic activity is artisanal fishing, the
              fishing sector is the most involved in the management of the
              Marine Reserve. Artisanal fishermen represent an important group
              in the economy. In recent years, the artisanal ability of the
              island's inhabitants has developed significantly.{"\n\n"}
              The use of recycled materials, t-shirt painting and wood carving
              is unique. Agricultural activities in the islands are not very
              technical, natural products grown organically are brought from the
              humid areas of the upper parts of the archipelago to be consumed
              in the ports.{"\n\n"}
              The music in Galapagos stands out for having happy rhythms with
              lyrics that talk about the daily life of the inhabitants of
              Galapagos.
